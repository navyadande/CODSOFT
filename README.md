Simple Calculator |Password Generator |Rock Paper Scissors Game

## A brief description 
Here we will be making 3 tasks:
1.Simple Calculator 
2.Password Generator
3.Rock Paper Scissors Game

# 1.SIMPLE CALCULATOR

## Overview

First of all, we will be making a simple calculator in which we can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division depending upon the user input.

Approach :
User chooses the desired operation.
Two numbers are taken and an if…elif…else branching is used to execute a particular section.
Using functions add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide() evaluate respective operations.
 The program defines a function called "calculator".


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x





# 2.PASSWORD GENERATOR


## Overview

The Password Generator is a simple command-line Python tool designed to create secure and random passwords. Users can specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. The tool then generates a random password based on these specifications.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x


# 3.ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

## Overview

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple command-line Python application where a user plays against the computer. The game follows the classic rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The game displays the choices for both the user and the computer and determines the winner based on the rules.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x


# Features

**1. SIMPLE CALCULATOR**

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Continue calculations with previous results
- Option to start a new calculation or exit


**2. PASSWORD GENERATOR**

- Generate passwords with a customizable number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
- Includes a diverse set of characters to ensure password complexity.
- Randomly shuffles the generated characters to enhance security.


**3. ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME**

- User input for Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Randomized computer choice.
- Display of game results (Win, Lose, or Draw).
- Simple ASCII art representation of the choices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/navyadande/CODSOFT.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd password-generator

Ensure Python is Installed:
Verify that Python 3 is installed on your system:
python --version

# Usage/Examples

## 1. SIMPLE Calculator

Run the Calculator:

Execute the Python script using:
python codsoft_taskno2.py

Follow the Prompts:

Enter the first number when prompted.
Select an arithmetic operation from the available options (+, -, *, /).
Enter the next number to apply the selected operation.
The result of the operation will be displayed.
Choose to continue with the result, start a new calculation, or exit.

*Example*


Select an operation: *
Enter next number: 5
8 * 5 = 40.0
Enter 'y' to continue calculation with 40.0 or 'n' to start a new calculation or 'x' to exit: y
Enter next number: 2
40.0 * 2 = 80.0
Enter 'y' to continue calculation with 80.0 or 'n' to start a new calculation or 'x' to exit: x
Operation completed

## 2. PASSWORD GENERATOR

Run the Password Generator:

Execute the Python script using:
python codsoft_taskno3.py

Enter the Desired Number of Characters:

The program will prompt you to enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in the password.
After entering the numbers, the program will generate and display a random password based on your specifications.

## 3. ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

Run the Game:

Execute the Python script using:

python codsoft_taskno4.py
Enter Your Choice:

When prompted, enter your choice:
Type 0 for Rock
Type 1 for Paper
Type 2 for Scissors
View the Results:

The game will display the ASCII art for both your choice and the computer's choice.
The outcome (Win, Lose, or Draw) will be printed based on the game rules.
